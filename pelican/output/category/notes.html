            <section><p>Why is replication important? In distributed systems, availability is a primary concern. For data to be available to clients, we need redundancy. So if a copy of data is maintained on multiple nodes. More nodes can serve reads if there are failures, or if a single node is not able …</p></section>

            <section><p>Data does not exist in isolation, it is supposed to be read once written. It can be thought of as a message. It can either be read immediately by any other program or stored to be read later. Or it can be just bottled and thrown in a messaging queue …</p></section>

            <section><h2>Relational data models</h2>
<p>Data models are central to what is possible with an application. There are many levels of abstraction at play here. A programmer, developing an application for an end-user will choose a certain type of model that fits the use case—for example, creating classes for real-world entities …</p></section>

            <section><h2>Storage Engines</h2>
<p>This chapter concentrates on storage engines. It addresses the question of how to store data for fast reads and writes. There are broadly two categories of storage engines. LSM-based and BTree based. LSM-based engines first write the data into memory as an efficient data structure and spill them …</p></section>

            <section><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I had always wanted to read Martin Kleppmann’s Designing Data-Intensive Applications, or DDIA as known among developers. I tried to read it many times but never really read it cover to cover. In July 2024, Alex Petrov’s book club voted to pick it as their next reading …</p></section>
